AES: using  acceleration: 3020.5 - 3061.5 + 3090.5 - 3110.5 = 61 T (one encryption,one decryption)
     before acceleration: 3158.5 - 33754.5 = 30596 T
     500X speed up

SHA256: using  acceleration: 33764.5 - 34010.5 = 246 T (two sha256 operation)
        before acceleration: 34103.5 - 44052.5 = 9949 T
        40X speed up
